After:

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/370d5ba0-90fd-4294-b8c3-1aa1ff5e66c6)

## Usage

1. Drag and drop your folder.
2. Double click the exe and write the directory.

## Attention

This project uses the default sorting behavior in Windows Explorer rather than Directory.GetFiles().

That means the order of files will not be disrupted. 

**No backup temporarily!**
